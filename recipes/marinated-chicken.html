        Making lasagna can be time-consuming, but the results are well worth the wait. You'll find a detailed ingredient list and step-by-step instructions in the recipe below, but let's go over the basics:
    </p>  
        
        <h3>ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>½ cups lemon-lime soda</li>
            <li>½ cup soy sauce</li>
            <li>¼ teaspoon garlic powder</li>
            <li>4 (6 ounce) skinless, boneless chicken breast halves</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>How to Make Marinated Chicken Step-By-Step</h3>

        <p>Here's a very brief overview of what you can expect when you make homemade marinated chicken:</p>

        <h3> Step 1</h3>
        <p>Whisk lemon-lime soda, olive oil, soy sauce, and garlic powder in a bowl and pour into a resealable plastic bag. Add chicken breasts, coat with marinade, squeeze out excess air, and seal the bag. Marinate in the refrigerator overnight.</p>
    
        <h3> Step 2</h3>
        <p>
            Preheat a grill to medium heat and lightly oil the grate.
        </p>
    
        <h3> Step 3</h3>
        <p>
            Remove chicken from marinade and discard used marinade. Cook chicken breasts on preheated grill until no longer pink in the center and the juices run clear, 7 to 8 minutes per side. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).
